  "whoami": "Hi, my name is UserR00T, also known as root. I am a software/backend developer for over 3 years now. My primary programming language is C#, and human language is Dutch. (Though as you can see, I can also speak English, but not as well) I also know a good bit of frontend, html/css/js, as you can see with this site. However, I don't like frontend as much as backend development. For backend I mostly use ASP.NET (C#), or Lumen/Laravel (PHP). I've also used node.js in the past to create a site's backend, which I would definitly try again if I had the time to do so. I have used MySQL for a very long time but recently I discovered NoSQL databases like MongoDB and I was instantly hooked. I've since never used MySQL again, though I can still use it if needed. I also created windows applications using C# and WPF/WinForms.",
